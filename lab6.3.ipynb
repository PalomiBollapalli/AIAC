            "---------------------------------------------\n",
            "**1. Readability:**\n",
            "   - **Nested if-elif-else:** For simple, sequential conditions, it's quite readable for beginners as it directly maps to common logical thinking. However, if the 'nesting' becomes too deep or the conditions very complex, it can become harder to follow.\n",
            "   - **Dictionary-based (Mapping):** Can be very clean and readable, especially for defining the ranges. The lookup logic (the `for` loop) is concise once the `age_ranges` structure is understood. It separates the data (age ranges) from the logic.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Maintainability:**\n",
            "   - **Nested if-elif-else:** Modifying age ranges requires directly editing the conditional statements. If a new group is added, it might involve rearranging `elif` blocks carefully to maintain correct logic flow.\n",
            "   - **Dictionary-based (Mapping):** Highly maintainable. Age ranges can be easily updated or extended by modifying the `age_ranges` list without changing the core classification logic. This separation of concerns makes it very flexible.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Suitability for Beginners:**\n",
            "   - **Nested if-elif-else:** Excellent for beginners as `if`, `elif`, and `else` are fundamental concepts. The step-by-step logic is intuitive, though 'nesting' might introduce a slight conceptual hurdle if explained too literally as deep indentation.\n",
            "   - **Dictionary-based (Mapping):** A bit more advanced. While the concept of a list of tuples is straightforward, understanding iteration through it and checking conditions within a loop might require a slightly better grasp of Python data structures and loops. However, it's a great pattern to learn for more complex scenarios.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Conclusion:** For a small, fixed number of simple age groups, both are viable. The `if-elif-else` is perhaps more immediately accessible to absolute beginners. For systems requiring frequent changes to age categories or more complex grouping logic, the dictionary-based (mapping) approach offers superior maintainability and flexibility.\n"
